Fizzbuzz
========

Going through the pair programming process to create a Fizzbuzz program with Kate!

Rules of the Game
-----------------

When you input a number divisible by 3, the program outputs 'fizz!'
When you input a number divisible by 5, the program outputs 'buzz!'
When you input a number divisible by 3 and 5, the program outputs 'fizzbuzz!'

General Process
---------------

We took turns adding a unit test to the spec and then updating the program to pass the test.

After finishing the program, we then went back and refactored our methods to clean it up a bit!
